BrainLink is an iOS app designed for managing patient and doctor data using Firebase authentication. This app allows doctors and patients to securely log in and interact with their respective dashboards, with role-based access control.

Current progress:
Mahad created a login system using firebase. The LoginVC has 2 options: Login as patient or doctor. Doctor in our case is admin, having access to everything while patient can only book the appointment and see doctors's prescription.
I also added registration system that allows doctors and patients to register themselves!
